# UCP Node.js Server Reference Implementation

This directory contains a reference implementation of a Universal Commerce
Protocol (UCP) server built with Node.js, Hono and Zod. It demonstrates how to
implement the UCP specifications for shopping, checkout, and order management.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v20 or higher recommended)
*   npm (Node Package Manager)

## Setup

1.  **Clone this repo**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/samples.git
    cd samples/rest/nodejs
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    Run the following command in this directory to install the required Node.js
    packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Database Setup**

    The server uses SQLite for persistence. Ensure the `databases` directory
    exists. The server will automatically initialize the database files
    (`products.db` and `transactions.db`) and tables on the first run.

    If the `databases` directory does not exist, create it:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p databases
    ```

    **Note:** For the server to function fully (e.g., to create a checkout), you
    may need to populate `products.db` with sample product data, as the server
    expects products to exist for validation.

## Running the Server

To start the server in development mode (with hot reloading):

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build and start the server for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The server will start on port **3000** by default. You can access the discovery
endpoint at:

```
http://localhost:3000/.well-known/ucp
```

## Running Conformance Tests

To verify that this server implementation complies with the UCP specifications,
use the official UCP Conformance Test Suite.

1.  **Get the Conformance Tests**

    Clone the conformance repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/conformance.git
    cd conformance
    ```

2.  **Run the Tests**

    Follow the instructions in the conformance repository to install its
    dependencies. Then, run the tests against this local server implementation.

    Assuming the conformance suite uses a configuration file or environment
    variables to target the server, ensure it is pointing to:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

## Project Structure

*   `src/api`: Contains the implementation of UCP services (Discovery, Checkout,
    Order).
*   `src/data`: Database access layer (SQLite).
*   `src/models`: TypeScript types and Zod schemas (some generated from specs).
*   `src/utils`: Helper utilities for validation and logging.
*   `databases`: Directory where SQLite database files are stored.
